## Introduction
In an era of increasing misinformation, especially in online media, it is crucial to have tools that help in validating the accuracy of information presented to the public. FactGuard automates the process of verifying facts in YouTube videos by using state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The project focuses on helping content creators and viewers identify misleading or inaccurate content by analyzing spoken text and cross-referencing it with verified sources.

## Features
- **Fact Verification**: Analyze spoken words in YouTube videos and verify facts using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
- **Automated Transcription**: Converts speech in videos into text, allowing for easy fact-checking.
- **Accuracy Report**: Generates detailed reports on the accuracy of facts presented in videos.
- **Customizable Data Sources**: Users can configure the trusted sources for fact-checking, enabling tailored verification for different contexts.
- **Scalable Design**: Built with scalability in mind, allowing the system to handle large volumes of video content efficiently.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or above
- Git
- A virtual environment manager (such as `venv` or `virtualenv`)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YASHWANTH1407/FactGuard.git
   cd FactGuard
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input the YouTube video link** for which you want to verify the facts.
2. **FactGuard** will automatically transcribe the video and analyze its content for factual accuracy.
3. Once processed, a **report** is generated, highlighting any potential inaccuracies or misleading claims along with their verification status.

### Example:

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Go to your browser and open `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever port is specified).
3. Input the YouTube video URL.
4. Receive a detailed report on the factual accuracy of the video content.

## Architecture
FactGuard leverages the **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. This framework combines retrieval of relevant data from trusted sources and generates fact-checking reports by cross-referencing video content with authoritative databases.

Key components:
- **Speech-to-Text Module**: Converts the audio from the YouTube video to text using state-of-the-art NLP models.
- **Fact Retrieval Module**: Searches trusted sources for factual information related to the spoken content.
- **Accuracy Engine**: Compares the facts retrieved from trusted sources with the statements in the video and identifies discrepancies.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask (for web interface)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, PyTorch
- **Natural Language Processing**: RAG, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup
- **Data Storage**: SQLite (can be replaced by any SQL database)
